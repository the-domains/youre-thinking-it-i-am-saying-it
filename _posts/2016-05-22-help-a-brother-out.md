description: "What should I call this thing? If you take a look at my post 'I was going to, but now I'm not' you can get an idea of the things I'd like to rant about. Basically I have created this as a place where I can rant without getting judgmental comments by my friends and family on Facebook. See I'm pretty opinionated and I need a place where I don't have to debate or fact check I can spew my feelings, right or wrong. Side note: For some reason I can't figure out how to make paragraphs in this content platform, enter doesn't work and neither does tab, weird. I'll put a ton of spaces in and see if it shows up right.

description: "I was going to make this into an angry blog where I rant about our terrible, condescending liar doctor, the corrupt medical and agricultural systems, the disgusting waste of tax dollars, assault on traditional white christian families, the grotesque and greedy propaganda designed to justify exorbitant new tax thefts, the emasculation of pretty much every aspect of our society... But I'm not going to because I am just too sick to my stomach. Honestly, it makes me want to do one of two things, join the army to beat out every ounce of weakness that has leaked into my system (it's the best thing I can think of right now), or move to a cabin in the woods and just ignore everything that is wrong. As much as I'd love to just check out, I know that's the emasculation talking. It's disgusting frankly and makes me sick but again that's the emasculation in me talking. I will probably wear that term out but you should get used to it. See, I married an incredible woman far better than I am and not only am I trying to live up to what she deserves, I know she would not be pleased if I used the urban term for emasculation... you know, the one that used to be used to describe a cat, starts with a 'P' and ends with -ification... Anyway I was going to talk about all that stuff but today I'm not. Maybe I'll be angry enough another day and a little less emasculated."

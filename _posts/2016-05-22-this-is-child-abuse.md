description: "I'm not gay and quite frankly I don't care if a person is gay but I do care about the abusive bulling that the SJDHBFSJHGDBK community does to force their way of life on the rest of the population.                                                                                                     1.7 percent of the US and Canada fall into that community, that's it and the emasculated rest of the populace allows and even celebrates people performing sex acts in the streets and exposing themselves to children, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CRIMES THAT WOULD PUT A PERSON ON THE SEXUAL OFFENDERS LISTS IF THEY WERE PERFORMED IN ANY OTHER SITUATION!!!                                        This is criminal, it's illegal and it is destroying the mental health of this child who is being abused by whoever brought him to this event. It's indecent, it's disgusting, it's crude, lewd, inappropriate and every other term the dictionary contains that fits this situations.                                                                                                                                  What it is not is a right, it's not sexual liberation, it's an assault on self respect, decorum, dignity and ever other virtue people with any ounce of self respect should be trying to develop.                                                                                                                            Here is the short of the whole situation (keep in mind I said short people, that also means simplified):                                                                                                                         1. If you believe in God, homosexuality is a sin, a weakness I wouldn't wish on anyone. But, the scriptures spell it out crystal clear and it doesn't fit into the whole plan God created for people.                                                                                                                        2. If you believe in evolution it's a surefire way to make sure you don't pass on your genes and end up extinct. So that doesn't make any sense either.                                          Of course, I am fully aware that these arguments mean nothing to the SJW's, leftists and anyone else who will accept whatever the mainstream opinions tell them too.     But Hey, it's just that simple to me. "

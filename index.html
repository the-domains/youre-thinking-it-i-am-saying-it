This is criminal, it's illegal and it is destroying the mental health of this child who is being abused by whoever brought him to this event. It's indecent, it's disgusting, it's crude, lewd, inappropriate and every other term the dictionary contains that fits this situations. What it is not is a right, it's not sexual liberation, it's an assault on self respect, decorum, dignity and ever other virtue people with any ounce of self respect should be trying to develop. Here is the short of the whole situation (keep in mind I said short people, that also means simplified): 1. If you believe in God, homosexuality is a sin, a weakness I wouldn't wish on anyone. But, the scriptures spell it out crystal clear and it doesn't fit into the whole plan God created for people. 2. If you believe in evolution it's a surefire way to make sure you don't pass on your genes and end up extinct. So that doesn't make any sense either. Of course, I am fully aware that these arguments mean nothing to the SJW's, leftists and anyone else who will accept whatever the mainstream opinions tell them too. But Hey, it's just that simple to me. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 d-f a-i-stretch no-padding title-size-large color-bg color-title section-bgcover-w section-height-fullscreen text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="42"><div class="Component p-1 ls-p-8 d-f fx-c j-c-between pos-r w-100p a-i-start t-a-l" data-reactid="43"><div class="Bg ov-h op-30 " data-reactid="44"><div class="Cover min-h-80px" data-reactid="45"><img class="color-loading" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/16cd86e9bbf56c59728ca5e8f65b8309/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F65e3b956-a2fd-4245-8de8-03b514d398a2.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:40.283203125% 68.15%;" data-reactid="46"/></div></div><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="47"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="48"><h1 data-reactid="49"><span class="" data-reactid="50"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="51">I was going to now I&#x27;m not...</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 52 --><!-- react-empty: 53 --><!-- react-empty: 54 --></div></div></section></div><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="55"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="56"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="57"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="58"><span data-reactid="59"><!-- react-empty: 60 --><h2 data-reactid="61"><a data-reactid="62">You&#x27;re Thinking It, I&#x27;m Saying It</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="63"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="64"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="65"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="66"></div></section></div></div>

If you take a look at my post 'I was going to, but now I'm not' you can get an idea of the things I'd like to rant about. Basically I have created this as a place where I can rant without getting judgmental comments by my friends and family on Facebook. See I'm pretty opinionated and I need a place where I don't have to debate or fact check I can spew my feelings, right or wrong. Side note: For some reason I can't figure out how to make paragraphs in this content platform, enter doesn't work and neither does tab, weird. I'll put a ton of spaces in and see if it shows up right. Here are some name ideas, tell me what you like. Thanks For Nothing. You're Thinking It, I'm Saying It. The Emasculation Station.
